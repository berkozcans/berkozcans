#### Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Let me tell you more about myself. I am 23 years old. As part of StudioDx, a thriving subsidiary under the esteemed SabancÄ± Holding, I'm proud to contribute to our cutting-edge e-procurement platform PratisPro, revolutionizing digital procurement. Our platform stands out with robust features, including multi-language support for a global user base.

#### Now, let's dive into our tech toolbox. At the backend, we're taking advantage of the Domain Driven Design (DDD) strategy. We are using the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern and Mediator pattern. Those strategies and patterns are empowering us to build a scalable and efficient system while dealing with a complex domain. C# .NET Core forms the backbone, and Vue.js adds flair to the frontend. Data is in good hands with PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and Elasticsearch keeps our logs organized. To ensure a seamless experience, we've implemented SignalR for real-time updates, keeping our users effortlessly informed.

#### Embracing a Backend For Frontend approach, we prioritize crafting code that not only functions flawlessly but is also user-friendly. In our agile environment, we follow the Scrum methodology with 2-week sprints, ensuring flexibility and efficiency in our development cycles.

#### It's an exhilarating journey here at StudioDx, where technology meets innovation. If you have something to share or ask, please feel free to contact me. :smile:
